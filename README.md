# PromptBase

[PromptBase](https://choppu.github.io/prompt-base/) is a prompt manager that fully runs in your browser. It downloads in your browser the remote database but any edit you do will remain in your local storage. The project is WIP and in active development.

NOTE: on first start it will need to download the database, so please be patient until it is done (images will appear dynamically).

The current database is a copy of the great work from [u/EternalDivineSpark](https://github.com/BesianSherifaj-AI). The prompts there are optimized for ZImageTurbo, but you can add your own prompt variants to work with other models.

### What you can do with it:

- Search the database for pre-made prompt snippets that allow you to obtain a specific style, camera angle, effect
- Store variants of said snippets
- Metadata viewer for jpeg and png. It supports images generated with Automatic111, ComfyUI, SwarmUI

### Upcoming features:

- Create new prompts
- Add/edit tags for better filtering
- Add multiple data sources
- Export single prompts as JSON file, in case you want to share them, or contribute them to the project
- Import/Export the database to file
